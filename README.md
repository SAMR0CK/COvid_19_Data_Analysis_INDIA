# EDA of COVID 19 Cases in India
Covid-19 has greatly impacted India with a total of 32393286 confirmed cases, 361340 active cases, 31597982 cured and 433964 deaths as of 20th August, 2021.

In this EDA, first implementation of web scraping over the the India Covid-19 State Wise Data set is performed and data extracted from https://prsindia.org/covid-19/cases . Later on, using this dataset we performed EDA to study which state is leading in terms of total confirmed cases upto date or which state has the highest number of active or death cases. Same has been visualised using various graphs using seaborn or plotly or matplotlib libraries. At last, chloropleth maps has been also used to showcase overall Confirmed cases, death, active cases on India map.

We see that the total confirmed in Maharashtra is the highest up till date 6 August 2021.

Maharashtra having the highest number of confirmed cases, also shows highest death ratio. We see that second highest is kerala, but the death ratio in kerala is not that high.

1) Plan to include day wise Covid-19 charts of India using web-scraping and live dataset. 

2) After I complete [Machine Learning with Python zero to gbms](https://jovian.ai/learn/machine-learning-with-python-zero-to-gbms) course by [Jovian](jovian.ai), future predictions of Covid cases will be performed.
